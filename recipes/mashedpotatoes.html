    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lb Idaho® Gold Potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
        <li>½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 fresh rosemary sprigs</li>
        <li>1 fresh thyme sprig</li>
        <li>1 fresh sage sprig</li>
        <li>1 garlic head, cut in half widthwise</li>
        <li>kosher salt, to taste</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the potatoes to a large pot of cold water, along with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 12 minutes, until the potatoes are fork-tender.</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes in a colander, then return to the pot. Increase the heat to medium-high and stir the potatoes around for 2-3 minutes to evaporate any excess moisture.</li>
        <li>Transfer the potatoes to a large bowl and mash with a potato masher, potato ricer, or by pushing through a fine mesh sieve with a spatula.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan, combine the heavy cream, rosemary, and garlic. Bring to a simmer over low heat, let cook for 2-3 minutes, until cream is infused. Remove the pot from the heat and strain through a fine mesh sieve.</li>
        <li>Add the cream mixture and melted butter to the potatoes and stir to incorporate, then season with salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Top with gravy and freshly ground black pepper, and serve warm.</li>
        <li><strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
    </ol>
